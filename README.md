# Assault Cube Trainer

This is a trainer for the open source game Assault Cube. 
The main purpose of publishing that project is to share some Reverse Code Engineering/C++ knowledge, and optimizing games protection mechanisms.

The currently supported features of the trainer include:
- Infinite Health
- Infinite Ammo
- Recoil disabled
- Automatic shooting for pistols
- Rapid Fire Enabled

The project also dissects the player's entity data structure, which helps understanding more about RCE, pointers and memory.
